By implementing milestone-based funding and community-driven evaluations, it ensures accountability for startups while providing a streamlined investment process for backers.  

Key benefits:  
- Enhanced transparency through milestone-based funding.  
- Investor-driven evaluations for startup approval.  
- Smart contract-enforced rules, ensuring integrity and reducing risk.

## Features  

1. **Submit Startups**  
   - Founders can propose their startups by submitting a title, pitch, funding goal, and milestones.  

2. **Milestone Management**  
   - Startups can define milestones, each with deliverables and funding allocations.  

3. **Investor Evaluations**  
   - Investors evaluate startups during a due diligence period and provide milestone-based funding.  

4. **Milestone Approval**  
   - Funds are released to startups after milestone completion and approval.  

5. **Result Transparency**

## Smart Contract Details  

The StarterLaunch smart contract is written in **Clarity**, with the following components:  

- **Constants**  
  Define thresholds for investment, evaluation, and platform constraints.  

- **Data Structures**  
  Maps for managing startups, milestones, evaluations, and investor stakes.  

- **Public Functions**  
  - `submit-startup`: Register a new startup.  
  - `add-milestone`: Add milestones for a registered startup.  
  - `evaluate-startup`: Investors evaluate startups and provide funding.  
  - `submit-milestone-progress`: Founders submit progress reports for milestones.  
  - `approve-milestone`: Admins approve milestones to release funds.  

- **Read-Only Functions**  
  Query startups, milestones, evaluations, and final results.  

- **Error Handling**  
  Clear error codes for various scenarios such as invalid inputs, unauthorized actions, and more.
